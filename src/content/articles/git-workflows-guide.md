# Practical Git Workflows for Teams

Choosing a workflow affects release cadence, risk, and developer productivity. Here's a quick comparison.

## Workflow Comparison Table

| Workflow              | Branching Model             | Release Cadence     | Pros                               | Cons                                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Git Flow              | long-lived develop + release| Fixed/Batch         | Structured releases, hotfix path   | Heavy branching, slower feedback    |
| GitHub Flow           | main + short-lived feature  | Continuous          | Simple, fast code review           | Harder for multiple release trains  |
| Trunk-Based Development | main + tiny feature branches | Continuous       | Very fast, fewer merge conflicts   | Requires strong CI, discipline      |

## Recommendations

- Small teams: GitHub Flow or TBD
- Regulated environments: Git Flow
- High-velocity product teams: TBD

## Tips

- Protect main branches
- Automate checks in CI
- Use conventional commits and small PRs

## Conclusion

Pick a workflow that matches your release strategy and culture, then invest in automation.
